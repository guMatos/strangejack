So, I'm learning Go, and decided I should do some kind of console game to pratice and study. Found a deck of cards web api and thought that I could go for a card game, started to browse the internet and stumbled upon these kind of weird and strange Blackjack rules, well, strange for me at least, never have I played or saw a game of Blackjack using these rules. One thing leads to another and I made it lol.

The code is kind of a mess, so it would be nice to have someone knowledgeable in Go come and point all the oddities in it. Weird code for a weird game I guess.
